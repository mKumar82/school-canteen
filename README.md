Frontend Assignment – School Canteen

This project is a frontend prototype built using Next.js, React, and Redux Toolkit.
It demonstrates managing snacks, students, and orders with a clean UI, responsive layout, and proper state management.

	•	react-redux (9.2.0) – Redux bindings for React
	•	react-hook-form (7.71.1) – Form handling and validation
	•	react-hot-toast (2.6.0) – Toast notifications for success and error states
	•	react-loading-indicators (1.0.1) – Loading spinners and loading states
	•	Tailwind CSS – Styling and responsive UI

🧪 Mock Data Approach

This project does not use an external backend.
	•	Backend behavior is simulated using Next.js API routes
	•	Data (students, snacks, and orders) is stored in memory
	•	The following APIs are mocked:
	•	GET /api/snacks
	•	GET /api/students
	•	GET /api/students/:id
	•	POST /api/students
	•	POST /api/orders
	•	Artificial delays are added to simulate real network latency
	•	RTK Query is used to manage loading, success, and error states

⚠️ Important Note About Deployment

This project uses in-memory mock data inside Next.js API routes.
	•	In local development, the Node.js server remains active, so data behaves consistently
	•	In deployed environments (e.g., Vercel), API routes run as serverless functions
	•	Serverless functions are stateless, meaning in-memory data is not guaranteed to persist across requests

As a result:
	•	Created students or orders may not persist reliably after deployment
	•	This behavior is expected and does not indicate a frontend bug
	•	A real backend/database would be required for full persistence in production
